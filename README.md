# Secure-Software-Development
The purpose of this coursework was to implement a Bug Tracker application 
for Safari Security Testing Services. This service allows users to log in and view tickets. A ticket
should be created for every bug that is found. 

Users included in the system included: Developer, Tester and a Guest.

## Security Aspects

1. The user is required to enter a valid combination of a username and password in
   order to access the application.
2. The userâ€™s details will be encrypted for security purposes (e.g. passwords)
3. The application will have unique user privileges for different users (developers,
   testers and clients), this will be handled via a separate database table
4. Connection to the application will be made secure by using TLS
5. A new session is created when a user logs into the system
6. The session will expire after 10 minutes if no user interaction is detected
7. The user is locked out after a certain number of failed attempts
8. Regular Expressions are used in order to reduce the chance of SQL Injection
